## Project Description ‚ùì
An Mobile Agriculture Application that aim to assist & help beginners and experts to facilitate the users in starting and managing a farm

This Include :
- Food crop & identification
- Planting guidance
- How to take care certain plant or crop
- Market potential information
- and other 

## Executive Summary/Abstract üìú
Agriculture is increasingly important for sustainability, food independence, and economic improvement. However, lack of knowledge and access to information hinders people from starting and managing farms. Flora Vista is a comprehensive farming application that provides solutions for crop identification, planting guidance, maintenance, and market information.

## My Role and Contributions üöÄ
As a Machine Learning Developer on the Flora Vista project, my responsibilities included:
- **Model Development**: I developed and refined machine learning models to accurately identify various food crops using image recognition technology. This involved extensive data preprocessing, feature extraction, and training the models using TensorFlow and Keras.
- **Data Processing**: I managed the collection, cleaning, and preprocessing of the agricultural datasets to ensure high-quality input for our models. I used libraries such as Numpy and Pandas for efficient data manipulation and analysis.
- **Model Testing and Validation**: I conducted thorough testing and validation of the machine learning models to ensure their accuracy and reliability in real-world scenarios. This included cross-validation techniques and performance evaluation using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Integration with Mobile App**: I worked closely with the mobile development team to integrate the trained models into the Flora Vista Android application, ensuring seamless functionality and user experience.

## Project Details üìÖ
**Team ID**: C241-PS256

**Final Selected Themes**: Smart Agri-Fishery Solution: Agrotech and Fisheries Technology Integration

**Title of the Project**: Flora Vista

**Problem Statement**:
Lack of accessible agricultural knowledge and information prevents individuals from engaging in sustainable farming practices, impacting food security and economic development.

**Research Question**:
How can an agricultural app leverage image recognition, planting guidance, and market insights to support users in farming activities?

**Background Information**:
Agriculture plays a vital role in food sustainability and economic growth, but urbanization has reduced engagement in farming.

**Reason for Solving the Problem**:
Addressing agricultural knowledge gaps can enhance food sustainability and economic resilience through informed farming practices.
